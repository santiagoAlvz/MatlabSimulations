# Eddy Currents Braking Simulation
This script calculates the way that an amusement park's freefall ride braking system will operate, and shows the result in graphic form.
- - -
The braking in a freefall ride usually works by the use of eddy currents, which stop the game through the electromagnetic resistance generated on the cabin while falling through a conductor, in this case a conductive ring.

Running this script will open a window, where four graphs are displayed:
- Cabin's position over time
- Cabin's speed over time
- Cabin's acceleration over time
- Current induced on braking ring
