# Volcano Simulation
This Matlab scripts simulates the trayectory that a piece of debris would follow if thrown from a volcano on certain conditions, which are specified by the user

- - -

The aforementioned conditions are:
- Angle (in degrees) on which the debris was thrown
- Initial velocity of the debris
- Height of the volcano (where the debris starts its trayectory)
- Air resistance, a constant which will be used for trayectory calculations

After providing the parameters, the program will show a small animation showing the debris' trayectory, alongside a table with the positions (in x and y) and velocities (in x and y) for every instant of the debris' fall.
